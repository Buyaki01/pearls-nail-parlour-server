# tech-notes-server

## Overview
This is the backend of a MERN application that provides a streamlined process for technicians to manage computer repair tickets requested by customers. Instead of relying on sticky notes, technicians can create, view, edit, and delete tickets through the application. The backend utilizes JWT tokens for authentication and authorization, allowing users to perform CRUD operations based on their roles within the company.

## Technologies Used
The backend of the app was built using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented database used for storing data in the application
- **Express**: A web application framework used for building the app's backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running the app's backend
